# Machine Learning from scratch!

To refresh my knowledge and prepare for any upcoming ML interview, I will attempt to implement/improve some basic machine learning algorithm from scratch using only python and limited numpy/panda function.
All of my model will be compared to existing models from popular ML library (sklearn, pytorch ...)
- [Linear Regression with weight decay (L2 regularization)](https://github.com/anhquan0412/basic_model_scratch/blob/master/linear_regression.ipynb)
- [Logistic Regression with weight decay](https://github.com/anhquan0412/basic_model_scratch/blob/master/linear_regression.ipynb)
- [Random Forest Regressor](https://github.com/anhquan0412/basic_model_scratch/blob/master/random_forest_scratch.ipynb).
- Random Forest Classifier
- Neural Network with weight decay and dynamic learning rate
- Convolutional Neural Network
